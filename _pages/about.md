<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Master's degree candidate in Computer Science at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), co-advised by Xiaoshuang Shi and Kaidi Xu. My research primarily focuses on hallucination detection and uncertainty quantification in multi-modality question-answering tasks, with applications to large vision-language models.

I have authored several papers on risk control and uncertainty estimation in AI, with publications in top-tier conferences like ICLR and EMNLP. My work aims to improve the reliability and factual accuracy of AI systems in real-world applications.

# 📚 Research
- Hallucination detection via uncertainty decomposition and quantification in (multi-modality) question-answering tasks of (black-box or white-box) large (vision-)language models across both closed-ended and open-domain settings;
- Statistically rigorous guarantees of task-specific metrics, such as correctness miscoverage rate and factuality, at various user-specified risk levels based on conformal uncertainty and significance test (conformal p-value).
