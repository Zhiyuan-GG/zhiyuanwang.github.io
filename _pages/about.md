Hi, I'm Zhiyuan Wang. I am currently a second-year Master's student in Computer Science and Technology at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), co-advised by Prof. [Xiaoshuang Shi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BWGQt3YAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Kaidi Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lYK0wlsAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I received my bachelor's degree (Hons.) in Internet of Things Engineering from Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (CQUPT) in 2023. 
My research interests include Uncertainty Quantification and Conformal Prediction in Large (Vision-)Language Models. 


# üìö Research
- Hallucination detection via uncertainty decomposition and quantification in (multi-modality) question-answering tasks of (black-box or white-box) large (vision-)language models across both closed-ended and open-domain settings;
- Statistically rigorous guarantees of task-specific metrics, such as correctness miscoverage rate and factuality, at various user-specified risk levels based on conformal uncertainty and significance test (conformal p-value).
