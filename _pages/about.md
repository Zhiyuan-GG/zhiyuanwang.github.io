Hi, I'm Zhiyuan Wang. I am a final-year Master's student in Computer Science and Technology at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), co-advised by Prof. [Xiaoshuang Shi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BWGQt3YAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Kaidi Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lYK0wlsAAAAJ&hl=en) (CityUHK). Previously, I received my bachelor's degree (*Hons*) in Internet of Things Engineering from Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (CQUPT) in 2023. 

My research interests include Uncertainty Quantification and Conformal Prediction in Foundation Models. 

I am very excited about potential collaboration opportunities! If you share similar research interests and find my work interesting, I warmly welcome you to contact me via email!
