<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Master's degree candidate in Computer Science at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), co-advised by Xiaoshuang Shi and Kaidi Xu. My research primarily focuses on hallucination detection and uncertainty quantification in multi-modality question-answering tasks, with applications to large vision-language models.

I have authored several papers on risk control and uncertainty estimation in AI, with publications in top-tier conferences like ICLR and EMNLP. My work aims to improve the reliability and factual accuracy of AI systems in real-world applications.
